# Math-Garden
This is a web app that displays an arithmetic garden. The app shows the user an arithmetic operation with a canvas where the user writes the answer. The tensor flow classification model running on the backend takes the preprocessed form of this answer and classifies the number. It returns this classification to the javascript function which checks if it corresponds with the actual answer to the arithmetic operation. The machine learning model was built with the TensorFlow framework and achieved an accuracy of 0.96 when tested on test new dataset
